Description: 
  In the process of model selection, the common practice is to select
  a model with the higher performance. However, the fine-tuning
  process might tune multiple models with negligible performance
  differences. This software provides a statistical procedure for
  comparing the performance of machine learning models using a
  bootstrapping technique to assess significant differences between
  models' performances. Additionally, it offers extra performance
  metrics such as the F-Measure and additional functionalities for
  working with the H2O AI software package. For more information
  about the 'h2o' package, visit https://h2o.ai/.
